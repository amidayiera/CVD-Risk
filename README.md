# Cardiovascular Risk Experiments

**A collection of calculators, experiments, and machine learning prototypes for cardiovascular disease risk prediction**

## Overview
This repository contains selected Colab notebooks from an ongoing research-grounded project focused on improving early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection and risk stratification
It includes:

- Baseline Risk Calculators (Framingham, WHO/ISH, Globorisk)
- ML Experiments (Multi-task learning, explainability with SHAP)

> **Note:**
This is a research prototype to reflect experimentation

## Status
All experiments are in development, built and tested on synthetic data. Full pipeline and production system are maintained in a private research repository.
